            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <l>From th' Author who this good old <hi>Play</hi> did mend.</l>
                  <l>He ſaid a <hi>Prologue</hi> was a Painted Clout,</l>
                  <l>Only to tell the <hi>Shew</hi> within, hung out,</l>
                  <l>And he no pains wou'd on the Clout beſtow,</l>
                  <l>When very few wou'd come to ſee the <hi>Show.</hi>

                  <l>Poor ſlighted Wit is flung among the Swine,</l>
                  <l>Like Grapes in <hi>France,</hi> now you forbid their Wine.</l>

                  <l>Let the Corn rot, and give their Labour o're,</l>
                  <l>And ſo the Vizards cackle here no more:</l>
                  <l>Or if they hither come 'tis but for fear,</l>
                  <l>Leſt zealous Conſtables find 'em elſewhere,</l>
                  <l>And their torn Coats for Romiſh Reliques ſeize,</l>
                  <l>And the poor Girles for Painted Images.</l>
                  <l>Thus all your Pleaſures wither and decay,</l>
                  <l>You 've ſuck'd the Globe, and flung the ſhell away.</l>

                  <p>I Am afraid I ſhall diſpleaſe you, by ſetting your Name, before ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous a thing as a Pamphlet of mine; but when I have told you the reaſon, I believe you will pardon me. I make not uſe of your Name to add a luſtre to mine; I am not ſo much concerned for it. Fame built on Poetry is like a Caſtle in the Air, which the next Wind demoliſhes. I have heard of great Armies Muſtered in the Air, but never of any thing they Conquered. Such are the Forces of Poetry, I have had my Ears torn with the noiſe of a Poets Drums and Trumpets, of the Bellowing of his Actors, and the clapping of his Audience, but I never heard of one inch of firm Land he gained. All he fought for was Inchanted Ground, which now he ſeems to poſſeſs, and anon it vaniſhes, has nothing real in it but the vexation of obſcene Birds, which diſturb him with their croaking, whilſt he wakes, and defile him by muting upon him if ever he ſleeps. No wiſe Man can much regard what his ſhare is in ſuch a barren and floating Place.</p>
                  <p>My concernment is for ſome little Truth and good Senſe, Commodities which no one will expect to find aboard ſuch a Paper Boat, as a Play, were it not convoy'd by ſo flouriſhing and great Reputation as yours.

My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſays, good Books ought to have no other Patrons but Truth and Reaſon. Many other things ought to be, that never will. If Truth and Reaſon were things ſo potent, how came Folly and Error to prevail over e'm in all Ages and Nations? How came Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to live among the Antients in Porches and Tubs, and Fools to ſhine in Palaces whilſt living, and in Temples when dead? How came Truth among Chriſtians to be troden under foot, for ſeveral hundreds of Years, whilſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Folly rode on mens Shoulders, and trod on Princes Necks? Mens Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had never been ſo ill us'd, if their Heads had been good. And when a Germane Fryar d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:54718:4"/> Gunpowder, how come the latter miſchievous invention, to have fifty times the ſucceſs of the former, and to pierce a hundred times as many Heads and Hearts? If Truth in Schools and Churches meet ſo much contempt, what muſt it expect in ſo wretched a thing as a Play is now eſteemed? The wiſeſt Men among the Ancients indeed, thought themſelves ſcarce wiſe enough to judge Drammatique Poetry, but ours think themſelves much too Wiſe, and throw it off as a Trifle for Women and Fools to play with; and by that means it pines more and more into a Trifle. For what vigour ſoever is neceſſary to pleaſe Ladies elſewhere, Impotence beſt delights e'm upon the Stage. The Poets that will hit the right Mark, muſt aim at the Boxes, and what Arrows they ſhoot over them are all loſt, nor are our Male Judges of a more Maſculine Spirit. I have always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved when an Actor talks Senſe, the Audience begins to ſleep, but when an unnatural paſſion ſets him a grimacing and howling as if he were in a fit of the Stone, they immediately waken, liſten, and ſtare, as if ſome rare Operator were about to Cut him: In ſhort, Senſe is ſo great a ſtranger to the moſt, that it is never welcome to Company for its own ſake, but the ſake of the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. For this reaſon I uſe your Name to guide that ſhare of it is in this Play through the Preſs, as I did <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s to ſupport it on the Stage. I called it in the Prologue <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Play, though he has no Title to the <hi>40th</hi> part of it. The Text I took out of his Second Part of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, but as moſt Texts are ſerv'd, I left it as ſoon as I could. For though <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally very delightful, h is not ſo always. His Volumn is all up-hill and down, <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was never more pleaſant than ſome parts of it, nor <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Greenland</hi> colder, and more uninhabitable then others. And I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to cultivate one of the moſt barren Places in it. The Trees are all Shrubs, and the Men Pigmies, nothing has any Spirit, or ſhape; the Cardinal is dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler then ever Prieſt was. And he has hudled up the Murder of Duke <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry,</hi> as if he had been guilty of himſelf, and was afraid to ſhew how it was done: But I have been more bold, to the great diſpleaſure of ſome, who are it ſeems aſhamed of their own myſteries, for there is not a Tool us'd in the murder of Duke <hi>Humphry</hi> in this Play, but what is taken out of their own Church Armory, nor a word put into the mouth of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and his fooliſh Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but what firſt dropt from the Heads that adorn their own Church Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements. I cou'd be large in Quotations did I not nauſeate Pedantry. I ſhall only ſhew that what ſerves here to make the Comical part of a Play, does in the Popiſh Countries compoſe the graveſt part of their Devotion. I make the fooliſh Murderer complain that he cou'd not thrive, though he kept every Day a Holy-day in honour of ſome Saint. Now nothing is more known then that in thoſe Countries, the great Trafique between them and their Saints, almoſt ruine all other Trades. The People are forced to keep ſo many Holy-days, that they have not Working-days enough to keep themſelves; when they ſhou'd be labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to fill their Bellies, they are cramming <hi>Latine</hi> into their Mouths, in the honour of ſome Saint, who perhaps underſtands not a word of the Language, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he learnt it ſince he died, which is a great doubt. And they have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saints, that the People in Heaven ſtarve thoſe upon Earth, and contrary to what is done in other Famines, the Dead devour the Living. No Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctury
<pb facs="tcp:54718:4"/> thrives like that of Saint-making, all others muſt contribute to that, and even the Workmanſhip of God muſt grow poor to enrich that of the Prieſts. When all the Saints had diſappointed this poor Fellow, I make him go to a Prieſt for advice, who inſtead of bidding him follow his calling, ſets him a mumbling a Prayer, which he tells him is of that efficacy, that if he ſays it over Thirty Days together, it will procure him in the end what ever he asks for. What appears too ridiculous here for the mouth of a Stage-fool, in a Country no leſs poliſhed then <hi>France,</hi> is recommended to the Faith and Devotion of no leſs a Prince then the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> in a little Book entituled, <q>HEVRES Dedidees a Monſiegneur le Dauphin, contenant L' Office qui ſe dit en L' Egliſe, ave l' Exercice du Matin, &amp; en ſoir, &amp; le Catechiſme dreſſe par les Peres de la Miſſion.</q> The Prayer is to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the <hi>229th</hi> Page, in the middle of the Prayer 'tis ſaid, —<hi>Here demand what ever you pleaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this Prayer would not do, I make the Prieſt give him another, Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Angel as he ſays into the Grave of a Germane Lady, who had her Head cut off, and lived after it two and twenty Hours, not being able to die, till ſhe had Confeſſed and Communicated. And the Prayer had this miraculous power annext to it, that whoſoever did but carry it about him, ſhou'd never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by Sea or by Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I found in a little French Book of Devotion to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> Licenced by the Fathers of the <hi>Auguſtine Friars,</hi> as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in it contrary to Catholick Faith, and recommended to the People with an extraordinary Approbation; by what Charter theſe Prayers claim ſuch great Priviledges, is not ſaid, yet muſt be believed. Some think me very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, for bringing what belongs to the Church upon the Stage; but they may allow me that, ſince they have carried many things that belong to the Stage into the Church. To expoſe theſe Follies to the People is the buſineſs of this Play, and I believe you will pardon me that I borrow ſome aſſiſtance from your Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſince you your ſelf have of late to your very great Honour, employ'd your Intereſt and excellent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the ſame deſign. And though you can do it better in common Converſation, then I by all my Study and Premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, It follows not, becauſe Lightning ſometimes ſhoots through all the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and rends the Oaks, a Man may not light a Candle in the Night: To hinder this Ruſh light from being blown out, is the reaſon why I place your Name before it. I have a mind the Play ſhou'd be read, and every one will read it, if they think you like it. I know few <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings ſo univerſally eſteem'd as yours, and for ſo good Reaſon. It wou'd be fooliſh in me to laſh out into unneceſſary praiſes of a Wit that has been ſo long the delight and ornament of the Nation, and is now become the Defence of what is very dear to it, Truth, Liberty, and Property. I have ſo deeply felt, what the loſs of Property is, that I cannot but honour the Defenders of it, though their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence comes too late to me. I may appear vain in my complaint, but People will Groan when they are in pain; my Father, and by conſequence my ſelf, his Heir, was ſtript long ſince (by the advice of ſome ill great Men, who ſacrifice
<pb facs="tcp:54718:5"/> both private and publick Intereſt to their own) of the Moity of a Province ſo conſiderable, the <hi>French Crown</hi> thought it worth contending for, many Years. And if that fortunate Kingdom ſtrove for it, you may imagine they got it. I have great hopes of a ſpeedy reparation from the great Juſtice Clemency and Goodneſs of his Majeſty. But this loſs made me run into that Madneſs, call'd Poetry, and inhabit that Bedlam, call'd a Stage. I have been ſo happy, that for ſeveral Years, certain Gentlemen unknown to me, have fallen on me, and endeavoured to Bleed me when ever I appear'd. I wiſh I knew 'em, that I might thank 'em for the Kindneſs they have done me, though they deſign'd me nothing but Miſchief. The grounds of their Antipathy I know not. Fools I confeſs may be very well moved to bark at Poets, from the ſame cauſe, that they ſay all kind of Dogs do at Skinners, from a natural inſtinct that gives 'em notice their own Hides are in danger. But I have no great ſcent of Blood upon me, and therefore muſt impute their Averſions to thoſe Occult Qualities that puzle Philoſophers. This convinces me, 'tis neceſſary for me to flie to ſome Wiſe Mans protection; and I cannot be ſafer than under yours. Poets are too poor to be beg'd, 'tis well if they can get Guardians for begging. I am confident you will be entreated to take upon you the Guardianſhip of this little parcel of a Mad-mans Eſtate, now I have told you for what good uſes it 'tis deſign'd. And if ſo, this will do well, and I ſhall live at eaſe, for thoſe who will behave themſelves very rudely to me as a Poet, and to this as a thing for publick entertainment, will be very civil to this when it is under your care, and to me when I am received by you: For</p>
